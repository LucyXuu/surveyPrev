## Version 1.0.0 Update
* The size of two directories leads to devtools::check() notes: data (3.0Mb) and doc (2.5Mb). The data directory contains necessary illustrative examples of complex survey data and maps. The doc directory contains static vignettes that provide more details in using the package. Dynamic vignettes are not possible because the computation of examples takes a long time and requires INLA installation. Since the package also concerns visualizing spatial smoothing models for fine geographic areas, the resulting vignettes are slightly larger in size as well. We have made the vignettes more concise and significantly reduced the size using the rmarkdown::html_vignette() output format. 
* Many examples in the package requires either INLA or registration with DHS to download the data. These are the expected use cases for the package, and thus are kept as is and wrapped around with dontrun().
